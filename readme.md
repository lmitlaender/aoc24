# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust by Lutz Mitländer
In this repository you will find my solution code for (hopefully) all Advent of Code 2024 tasks.

This year I decided to go for rust as my language of choice as I'm interested in taking a closer look at it, and at lower level languages in general.. a bit too much Python at work maybe (╯•ᗣ•╰)

I'll be trying to avoid external dependencies throughout the journey, so if someone is ever tempted to run this I hope you'll not need to install anything external.
